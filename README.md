# MY-NEW
This is my first step
I love computers and want to be a programmer.
So learning Python is a starting point for me to get into programs, and it's going to be a springboard for me.
My goal is to be able to write small games and things like that after learning Python.
Learning it to work is, of course, the minimum requirement
